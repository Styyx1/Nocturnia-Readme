## Most Important Gameplay Changes

### Combat:
- Damage has certain ranges, so, not every hit deals the same amount of damage.
- You are semi-locked into attacks as I reduced the attack angles. This is also true for NPCs to even it out.
- Timed block is most likely your most valuable tool early on to survive encounters
- vastly increased enemy density. I like combat, so I made more of it.
- Enemies can spawn on your way out of certain dungeons
- MIMICS
- Combat can and will cause stress which can lead to certain fears. 
- Stances, while not having different animations, will give you different advantages and disadvantages in combat

### Exploration:
- Many areas from the base game are changed
- you need to have a compass item in your inventory to see the compass, it will break after some time
- to open a map, you need to have a map in your inventory, it will break after 20 usages
- there are no quest markers. not on the map, not on the compass, not in the air.
- staying in the dark for too long without proper light will increase the stress level of your character and it will lower your vision

### Followers:
- I don't like playing with followers, so the choices are limited
- Redcap
- Styx (spectral wolf companion)
- All followers can die
- Follower and you deal less damage the bigger your party is

Novice and Apprentice difficulty buff the player

# Tips

- Lower the difficulty if it's too hard. Requiem normalises the damage values so difficulty doesn't affect that, but in Nocturnia, there is something extra that does change with the difficulty.
- Playing with a bow makes the start of the game a bit easier if you manage to keep your distance.
- change the damage ranges in STweaks.ini. It might make your attacks weaker, but it also can give you a huge boost in damage. Note, this also affects NPC damage.
- Take a compass, a map and a torch in the starting choices menu. Those 3 items are cheap to craft there and will make the start a lot easier. Especially the torch since darkness will give your character stress and this will affect the visibility in dungeons and your stamina/magicka pool.
- For the love of *insert deity here* not every encounter can be won. Nocturnia has a lot of random encounters, run away and come back later with better gear/perks.
- If you really need quest markers, disable ``Nocturnia - No Markers`` in MO2, you still won't have floating markers, but at least you will see markers on your compass
- there are potions of wayfinder to act like the ``Clairvoyance`` spells for non-casters. This helps you finding quest targets.
